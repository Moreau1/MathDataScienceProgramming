Biography
First of all, I am  Pierre Rubens Emmanuel MOREAU,  I am studying Public Health at Archipel University. My date of birth is November 23rd 1998.
I live with my family, my mother, my father and my 4 four siblings. I live in Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti. 
I have been teaching since 2017 at the present day in many high schools including institutes.

From 2017 to 2018, I taught in English Class at CTFP (Centre Technologie et de Formation Professionnelle) and I worked as a Regional director and academic manager in the central office.
In the year of 2018, I have joined a group of young people at CEFOTC (Centre de Formation Technique et Commerciale) where I have been teaching English and working as an academic manager, a volunteer job. 
On the other hand, From 2019 at the present time, I have been teaching at two high schools in Carrefour. The first is College Historia and the second is College Sciences et Lettres.   
I am a community organizer, I have been working with young people where I have taught leadership, entrepreneurship, social skills and citizenship.
With children either by teaching in Sunday school at church and sometimes I share a little support to them by organizing some activities where they find foods, show their talents, etc. 

I had my certifications in professional schools on basic computer skills at AICTP (2015-2016),  project management and planning in a seminar with an organization (RECI), Leadership and Entrepreneurship in an annual summer class with Cheri Huerta (President of Haiti Share, leaving in Texas, USA) and for the second semester of this year  I hope to start a study in spanish. 
In conclusion, I am a student graduating in communication at ISNAC from (2019-2021).

**Thursday, June 10th 2021 Mathematical logic
Assignment II**

Just before starting with the main topic, let’s make a little history about Mathematical logic.
First of all, Aristotle identified some patterns in human reasoning and Leibniz (a German philosopher, mathematician, scientist, diplomat and polymath.) dreamt of reducing reasoning to calculation.
Secondly, we have other people focusing on boolean algebra (in mathematical logic, Boolean algebra is the branch of algebra in which the values of the variables are the truth values true and false, usually denoted 1 and 0, respectively.), set theory, propositional logic, predicate logic, etc. People like cantor, Peano
In the period 1900- 1950, people discovered the first real theorems in mathematical logic. We talked about the first incompleteness theorem and the second incompleteness theorem. 
**
**To focus on mathematical proof we must focus on: Logical reasoning & Notation and the different methods of proofs.** **
There is a certain vocabulary and grammar that underlies all mathematical proofs, logical statements  such as ‘Or’. ‘If’. 
Statements and logical operations, sentences that are either true or false but not both.
As well as arithmetic, we can combine with operations, some of these are ‘and’. ‘or’, ‘not’, if … then, If and only if, for every and there exists are called quantifiers. 
Therefore, the constructive proof is the most basic kind of proof there is. It is a proof that starts with a hypothesis, and a person uses a series of logical steps and a list of axioms, to arrive at a conclusion.
Secondly, there is the method of proof by contradiction used  to assume that a statement is not true and then to show that that assumption leads to a contradiction.. This is known by its latin reductio ad absurdum (reduction to absurdity), since it ends with a statement that cannot be true.
Lastly, there exists the method of induction and the beauty is  that it allows a theorem to be proven true where an infinite number of cases exist without exploring each case individually. 

Finally, a  new concept was born in the early part of the 20th century “Foundational crisis in mathematics”, a strong impulse for developing mathematical logic.
In the second half of the 20th century, It was divided into four main areas: model theory, computability theory, set theory and proof theory.

Thank you
2. Pooh proof
   - What type of proof does Piglet point out?
     In my opinion, I think Piglet point out a Deductive proof. 
   - What axioms does Pooh assume for his proof that poor piglet might have doubts about?
    The axiom is a proposition considered obvious, admitted without proof. In this case the axiom is "if it is raining, the heffalump will look up to the sky and wonder "when will it clear up?", 
    
### Your learning notes of the week:
#### What was easy to understand? 
From those three weeks, I do understand things like the different types of proofs because I was reading the booklets and I was making a lot of research from online articles. 

#### What was hard to understand? 

It was how to manage my github account because it was the first time using it. Howerver, the video recorded for the week three help me getting more informations about it. 


#### What do you need to recapitulate?
It's okay for me. I am jut waiting for the upcoming weeks.


## Proofs, Part 2
Your first step made you familiar with notation and basics of proof.
Some proofs require multiple steps and cases.

```
There is a story in winnie-the-Pooh by Milne who was a mathematician:
Piglet is a fearful being, and very afraid of the Heffalump.
Pooh wants to help and builds a Heffalump trap: a big hole.

Piglet has doubts that this will work, as a fearful being... and asks for proof.

Pooh proof: 

the heffalump will walk along, and it is a nice day, 
thus the heffalump will look up to the clear sky and think "what a nice day", 
thus not seeing the hole, 
thus woops he is trapped.

Piglet has a doubt: "what if it is raining?"
Pooh: if it is raining, the heffalump will look up to the sky and wonder "when will it clear up?", 
thus not seeing the hole, 
thus woops he is trapped.

Hmmm.
```


To understand Milne's joke understand chapter 5 in <https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/college-eps/college/stem/Student-Summer-Education-Internships/Proof-and-Reasoning.pdf>.


Notation is how you write.
Proof is how you answer "why?", rigorously in notation.

Your next step is clarifying "what?".
What are the elements in addition?

Numbers, for example!
Numbers are a set.

Understand chapter 10 in <https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/college-eps/college/stem/Student-Summer-Education-Internships/Proof-and-Reasoning.pdf>.

Then you understand a precise way of "what". 
Want to blow your mind more? 
Read up on [Russel's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox).
Learn to use Wikipedia (switch to French, easily learn technical english).

To know "what" is talked about more clearly, it helps to think about some attributes of "it".
That idea is captured in precise terms as "function".
Start peeking into chapter 11 in <https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/college-eps/college/stem/Student-Summer-Education-Internships/Proof-and-Reasoning.pdf>.



If you read thoroughly on proofs you already have had your first Heureka!
Maybe you were not aware...
Take the time to find the tiniest feeling of Heureka-joy by re-reading chapter 1-4.
Make that joy big and strong.
It is earned.

When joy is leaving you:
Take time to think and mentally digest.
Accept frustration. 
Learning takes time.
Walking slow and steady is good.
Only not walking at all means never arriving.

Familiarize yourself! Read up on it and think until it is familiar. 
Learn by heart,
seriously, until you can explain it to your inner child.

You WILL memorize these increasingly over time 
because notation and proof are required to read any other material...
