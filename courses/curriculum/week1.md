Welcome to the course to enable you as student tutors to learn and teach in these fields  *Mathematics, Data Science, and Programming* Education at Archipel university.

# The curriculum aims at developing your study program
prefering open and freely accessible materials.

How will we do this?

The curriculum is created together with prospective student tutors following the Archipel Schedule template with Dr. Kappler supervising a weekly session, and homework is to put together the following materials.

For each course below, we

1.  collect and evaluate open course materials (e.g. MIT open courseware <https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/>).
2.  collect and evaluate recommended readings, preferably openly accessible.
3.  start compiling important questions, and create a study map what understanding is required to proceed to the answer of a question.
    The goal is to create a guide of prerequisites for studying mathematics/statistics/probability theory enabling recommended and individual learning trajectories.

After reviewing and discussing my suggestion of curriculum content, we assign tasks to compile and discuss material to prospective tutors.
The curriculum content is presented on the collaboration platform <http://github.com> and tasks are assigned there.


## Mathematics:

Enables students to master the essential mathematical tools and concepts,
that are elemental for major mathematical specializations.

The curriculum familiarizes with

1.  *Category* Theory to understand elements and functions, and dimensions as cross products,
2.  *Logic* to understand formal mathematical notation, proofs, as well as natural numbers,
3.  *Calculus* to understand the intricacies of continuity,
4.  *Linear Algebra* to master the most simple kind of nontrivial relations.
5.  *Multivariate Calculus*
6.  *Differential Equations*

These concepts are used all over across mathematical research as well as industry.
With this solid foundation you can pursue more advanced topics,
in pure mathematics, as well as applications.

## Data Science:

The curriculum familiarizes with mathematical courses

1.  *Probability Theory* to understand how to observe and estimate beyond the proofable,
2.  *Optimization*
3.  *Statistical Models*

The curriculum teaches how to apply your understanding in these courses

1.  *Data paradigms*: types and tables, dictionaries and databases
2.  *Writing LaTeX*
3.  *Visualizing quantitative information* (Tufte) &#x2013; the grammar of scientific graphics
4.  *Public Data* Science &#x2013; Growing a public data repository for study and research (Information Mycelium).

## Programming:

1.  *Discrete cathematics, the Turing machine and stateful programming*
2.  *Lambda calculus and stateless programming*
3.  *Communication* paradigms: networks, APIs, servers
4.  *Languages* and tools for data science:  *Julia*, (*R*, *Python*)



## Homework:
This homework is ongoing through all 7 weeks of the course.

1.  for each course **that you are currently working on**,
    find two courses in either math, data science/statistic, or programming/computer science.
    Provide links to online course material (open, free access).
2.  for one topic **below that you find interesting**,
    google for two open courses in either math, data science/statistic, or programming/computer science.
    Provide links (min 2) to online course material (open, free access).
3.  create a github account, and fork this repository for your website


Next week I will
-   discuss the plan below with your contributions woven into it.
-   learn you the basics of git issues, so we can coordinate/discuss tasks.
